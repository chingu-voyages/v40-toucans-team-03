## [Title]

T3 Gym Home/Landing Page

## [Overview]

The purpose of this project is as part of a team project for Chingu Voyage 40. It is a hypothetical one-page brochure site advertising and detailing a fictional upcoming and modern but minimal gym.

## [Features]

The site for the gym is split into different sections with various information and/or functions. Details include:

### [[Sections]]

- Main Navigation (speaks for itself)
- About Us (info about the gym and the people behind it)
- Our Features (main features and selling points of the gym)
- Our Locations (where the gym is located)
- Pricing Plans (pricing packages available to clients and their features)
- Testimonials (a few customer reviews endorsing the gym)
- Sign Up/Sign In (users interested in the gym can enter their details and sign up, or sign into an existing account)
- Footer (much like the main navigation, also speaks for itself)
